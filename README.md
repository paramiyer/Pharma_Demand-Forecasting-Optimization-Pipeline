# Demand Forecasting & Optimization Pipeline

This project contains a time series modeling and optimization notebook designed for structured demand forecasting and scenario planning. It leverages common Python libraries for data preparation, statistical modeling, and visualization, while also integrating linear optimization logic.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Clean, modular pipeline for time series data preprocessing
- Forecasting using statistical models (e.g., ARIMA, exponential smoothing, regression)
- Scenario-based simulations to explore future trends
- Incorporates linear optimization using Google OR-Tools to solve constrained planning problems
- Inline visualization of forecasts and model behavior
- Ready for adaptation to real-world supply chain or business planning problems

## ðŸ—‚ File Structure
- `main.ipynb`: Main notebook with embedded code, outputs, and documentation
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependency list

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Launch the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook main.ipynb
   ```
